<h3>Sanam Teri Kasam</h3>
<p>One of those romantic movies which was succesful of extracting the essence of romance and emotions without creating cringe scenes. 
    It depicted love, sacrifice and loyalty beautifully.</p>

<h3>Sanju</h3>
<p>Ranbir Kapoor's top notch performance. The storyline made the audience to stay hooked to their screens. All the emotions like shock,
    happiness,sadness,anger,everything was delivered swiftly by the movie.Highly recommended.

<h3>Tain To Busan</h3>
<p>As a movie lover I really love zombie acolypse based movies. This movie perfectly showed the horror. It's nail bitting scenes
    and the relation between father and daughter has been perfectly depicted in this movie which led to a very emotional ending.
